    "\n",
    "If partial derivatives are less than $1$ then the chain rule product increasingly shrinks towards zero with each added neural network layer, which is the vanishing gradient problem. A vanishing gradient thus limits how \"deep\" neural networks can be since later gradients (deeper into the chain rule product) will be increasingly shrunk towards zero, making learning the parameters at deeper neural network layers a much slower process (and thus a much more intractible computational problem) than than learning the parameters at earlier layers.\n",

Standardizing outputs using **batch norm** means zero valued outputs become negative lower bounds on outputs, which \"reactivates\" their signals and corresonpding potential for non-zero downstream gradients. The standardization also means gradient surfaces are more sphereical (as opposed to variance elongated or correlation diagonalized ellipsoid) shaped, which equalizes the partial derivatives within a gradient, further reducing the potential for vanishing gradients along any particular axis. And **momentum** and **RMSprop** (and **Adam**) like algorithms further work to reduce limit the vanishing gradients problem. \n",
